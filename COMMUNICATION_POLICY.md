# HearMeTech Communication Policy

At HearMeTech, our mission requires deep, focused work. This policy isn't for bureaucracy; it's to protect your time, focus, and to build a transparent, effective team.

Our key principle is: **"Asynchronous by default, synchronous when necessary."**

We respect each other's time and understand that the best work (especially in R&D and engineering) requires long periods of uninterrupted focus.

## 1. Our Tools and Their Purpose

Choosing the right tool is essential.

### 🔴 Slack (or similar): For quick, non-urgent conversations
This is our digital office.

* **Use for:**
    * Quick questions that need an answer (but not *immediately*).
    * General announcements (`#general`).
    * Sharing interesting articles or findings (`#random`, `#learning`).
    * Team coordination (`#backend`, `#mobile`).
* **Etiquette:**
    * **ALWAYS use Threads.** Do not clutter the main channel with replies.
    * **Public Channels > DMs.** Your question might be useful to someone else. Ask it in the open unless it's truly private.
    * **Avoid `@here` and `@channel`** except for *true* emergencies (e.g., "Production is down!").
    * **Respect status.** If someone is in "Focus Time" or "In a meeting," don't expect an instant reply.

### 🔵 GitHub: For everything related to code
This is our "single source of truth" for development.

* **Use for:**
    * Discussing bugs or new features (Issues).
    * Discussing specific code implementation (Pull Requests).
    * Maintaining technical documentation (Wiki or `README.md`).
* **Etiquette:**
    * **No technical decision should be "lost" in Slack.** If you discuss something important in Slack, summarize it and bring it to a GitHub Issue or PR.
    * Be clear and constructive in your PR reviews.

### ⚪️ Email (Google Workspace): For official and external communication
This is our official channel to the world.

* **Use for:**
    * Communicating with external partners, clinics, or investors.
    * Official documents (contracts, proposals).
    * Communicating with users (`info@hearme.tech`, `support@hearme.tech`).
    * Vulnerability reports (`security@hearme.tech`).
* **Etiquette:**
    * Do not use email for internal conversations that can happen in Slack or GitHub.

### 🟢 Video Calls (Google Meet): For synchronous, complex discussions
This is our tool for solving hard problems and building team bonds.

* **Use for:**
    * Weekly team syncs (Sprint Planning, Retrospectives).
    * 1-on-1 meetings.
    * Complex discussions that would take >10 minutes in Slack.
    * Product demos.
* **Etiquette:**
    * **Always have an agenda.** A meeting without an agenda is a waste of time.
    * **Start and end on time.**
    * **Cameras on** (by default). It helps build human connection. (With respect for circumstances, of course).

## 2. Key Communication Principles

1.  **Async is Respect.**
    * When you send a message, don't expect an instant reply.
    * Formulate your message completely so the recipient doesn't have to ask clarifying questions. (Bad: "Hey, you there?" / Good: "Hey, when you have a moment, please look at PR #123. I'm unsure about the error handling in `auth.py`.")

2.  **Transparency by Default.**
    * Default to public channels in Slack and discussions in GitHub Issues. This allows the whole team to learn and stay in context.

3.  **You Are Not Your Calendar.**
    * Block "Focus Time" in your calendar for deep work.
    * Turn off Slack notifications when you are in focus. This is not just allowed; it's encouraged.

4.  **Empathy and Respect.**
    * Remember there is a human behind every avatar.
    * All our communications must adhere to our **[Code of Conduct (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`)](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.
