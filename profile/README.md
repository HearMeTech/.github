# HearMeTech Community Standards

This repository holds the default community health files and standards for the entire @HearMeTech organization.

### What is this?

The files in this `.github` repository (like `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and issue/PR templates) are automatically applied by GitHub to all other repositories within our organization.

This ensures a single, consistent set of standards for:
* Contribution guidelines
* Code of conduct
* Engineering best practices

By centralizing these files, we build a consistent and professional engineering culture across all our projects, from our website to our core AI engine.
