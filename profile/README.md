Millions of people struggle to be understood due to conditions like Cerebral Palsy, stroke complications, or degenerative diseases. Standard speech recognition fails them because it's trained on "typical" speech.

**We are changing that.**

`HearMeTech` is building a deeply personalized speech recognition engine. Instead of a one-size-fits-all model, our technology learns an individual's unique speech patterns, bridging the gap between their voice and the digital world.

### ðŸŽ¯ Our Goal

To create technology that enables our users to:
* **Speak** and be instantly understood.
* **Text** using their own voice.
* **Communicate** with clarity and confidence.

### ðŸ§  Our Technology

We are focused on developing:
* **A core AI engine** that learns and adapts to unique vocal patterns.
* **An intuitive mobile app** ('Hear Me') that serves as a personal voice assistant and communicator.
* **Future integrations** with keyboards, voice assistants (Siri, Google), and messaging apps to bring accessibility everywhere.

### ðŸš€ Join Our Mission

This is more than just code. This is about unlocking human potential.
