# HearMeTech Community Standards & Governance

Welcome to the central governance repository for the **@HearMeTech** organization.

This repository holds the default community health files, standards, and cultural documents that define how we build products and work together.

### What is this?

The files in this `.github` repository (like `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue templates, etc.) are automatically applied by GitHub to all repositories within our organization.

This ensures a single, consistent set of standards for our engineering culture across all projects.
