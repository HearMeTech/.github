# HearMeTech Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders of the HearMeTech community, we pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. Our work is centered on empowering individuals with disabilities, and our community culture must reflect that core mission of empathy and respect.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* **Using welcoming and inclusive language.**
* **Being empathetic** towards other people's perspectives and experiences.
* **Being respectful** of differing viewpoints and experiences.
* **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.**
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for the project, but for our users and community.
* **Showing appreciation** for the efforts of other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting or in a community dedicated to accessibility.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers (the `HearMeTech` core team) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (our GitHub repositories, issue trackers, pull requests) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing our project include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the `HearMeTech` leadership, who are responsible for enforcement.

Please contact us at **[contact@hearme.tech]**. *(Note: This email address should be a confidential and monitored inbox).*

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All project leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
